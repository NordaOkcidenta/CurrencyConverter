An intuitive and visually appealing iOS currency conversion app, as our first iOS app project, inspired by the UI design from rhagency

- Rates are updated daily, if everything goes as expected.
- Sourced from fawazahmed0's currency-api.


This project is solely made for our practice in iOS development and is not intended as a product for the general public.
